			<h4>About Me</h4>
			<p>Hello! I am Kristina, and I am a student at Epicodus. I am in the 2020 C# and React cohort.</p>
			<p>I moved to the US in 2011 and since than, I worked at two large Healthcare systems in Oregon: first at OHSU and than in Providence Health & Services.</p>
			<p>For the past 5 years, I worked in Healthcare Administration as a Contract Specialist.While I liked the people I worked with, I did not see myself doing that type of work forever. I did some research on coding, played with it a little and I liked it!</p> 
			<p>So, that is how I ended up here at Epicodus!</p>
			<h5>Interests/Hobbies/Skills</h5>
			<p>When I am not in school, I like to take Barre classes. Barre is a type of hybrid workout class - combining ballet-inspired moves with elements of Pilates, dance, yoga and strength training</p>
