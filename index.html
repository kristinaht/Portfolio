						<h4>About Me</h4>
						<p>Hello! I am Kristina, and I am a student at Epicodus. I am in the 2020 C# and React cohort.</p>
						<p><strong>I was born in Belgrade, Serbia, where I got my Bachelor's in Economy</strong>. I moved to the US in 2011 and since than, I worked at two large Healthcare systems in Oregon: first at Oregon Health & Science University and than in Providence Health & Services.</p>
						<p>For the past 5 years, I worked in Healthcare Administration field as a Contract Specialist. While I liked the people I worked with, I did not see myself doing that type of work forever. I did some research on coding, played with it a little and I liked it!</p> 
						<p>So, that is how I ended up here at Epicodus!</p>
						<h5>Interests/Hobbies/Skills</h5>
						<p>When I am not in school, I like to go to Barre classes. Barre is a type of hybrid workout class - combining ballet-inspired moves with elements of Pilates, dance, yoga and strength training</p>
						<p>I love to travel! So far, I have been to countries on three Continents, which means I have a lot more travelling to do!</p>
